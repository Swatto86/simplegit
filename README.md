## GitHub OAuth Setup

To use the GitHub authentication feature, you need to set up a GitHub OAuth App:

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App**:

   - Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Click on "New OAuth App"
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - **Application Name**: SimpleGit (or any name you prefer)
     - **Homepage URL**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (development) or your production URL
     - **Authorization Callback URL**: [http://localhost:3000/callback](http://localhost:3000/callback)
   - Click "Register Application"

2. **Obtain Client ID and Client Secret**:

   - After creating the app, GitHub will provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. These are crucial for the OAuth process.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
   env
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
4. **Authorize the Application**:
   - When you start the authentication process, you will be redirected to GitHub to authorize the app. This step is necessary to grant the app access to your repositories.
